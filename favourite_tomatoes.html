<div id="placeholder1" style="width: 500px; height: 800px;"></div>

<p>You don't have to do much to get an attractive plot. Create a placeholder, make sure it has dimensions (so Flot knows
    at what size to draw the plot), then call the plot function with your data.</p>

<script>
    preparePlot();
</script>

<p>The axes are automatically scaled.</p>
